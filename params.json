{"name":"Alfred-show-me-the-klout","body":"# What is \"Show me the Klout\"?\r\n\"Show me the Klout\" is an [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) extension built using Python, that provides a quick way to know if someone is worth following on Twitter by providing critical information like their [Klout](http://klout.com) score, what's their follow vs following ratio, when did they join Twitter, number of followers, number of followings - all with a hit of a keystroke through the power of Alfred. It displays this info via a Growl notification.\r\n\r\n## What is Alfred?\r\n[Alfred](http://alfredapp.com) is an award-winning productivity application for Mac OS X, which aims to save you time in searching your local computer and the web. Whether it's maps, Amazon, eBay, Wikipedia, you can feed your web addiction quicker than ever.\r\n\r\nThe real power of Alfred lies in it's [powerpack](http://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/) that allows you to create your very own Terminal shell scripts, AppleScripts, workflows, search filters and file groups to extend Alfred.\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nSo, you met someone new at an event or found some one interesting on the inter-webs. What's the first thing you do? Find them on Twitter. Analyze if they're worth following. How do you do that? Every time, I meet some one new, there are somethings I wanna know about them to judge if they're worth following - \r\n\r\n1. What's their Klout score?\r\n2. When did they join Twitter? (It's true. I'll totally judge you on when you joined Twitter - if you were an early adopter or not. I know, am weird :)\r\n3. What's their Follow vs Following ratio? (This is important to me. A ratio of less than 1 tells me, you're either not active on Twitter or are a spammer. Either way, probably not worth a follow.) \r\n4. Number of Followers\r\n5. Number of Followings\r\n\r\nI don't know why I do that. I just do and I do it enough to encourage me to come up with a simpler and faster process than look up people's profiles each time on Twitter.com or a Twitter client. \"Show me the Klout\" does just that, with just a keystroke. So, you know quickly if this person is worth a follow.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n1. [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) + [Alfred Powerpack](http://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/)\r\n2. [Klout API Key](http://developer.klout.com)\r\n3. [Twitter API Key](http://developer.twitter.com)\r\n4. [Tweepy](http://tweepy.github.com/) - A Python library for accessing the Twitter API\r\n5. [Growl](http://growl.info)\r\n5. [Nice and shiny Mac](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=get+a+mac) - Of course you have one!\r\n\r\n## How to Use\r\n\r\n1. Make sure Alfred is running. \r\n2. Just hit your Alfred keyboard shortcut. In my case I have it configured it as **CMD + SPACE**. (The default is probably **ALT + SPACE**)\r\n\r\n\t![Alfred Launch Bar](https://github.com/mashery/Alfred-Show-Me-The-Klout/raw/master/images/alfred_launch_bar.png)\r\n3. Type the keyword **ks** followed by a Twitter handle (You can change the keyword by editing the info.plist file)\r\n\r\n\t![Alfred Launch Bar](https://github.com/mashery/Alfred-Show-Me-The-Klout/raw/master/images/alfred_launch_bar_fill.png)\t\r\n\t\r\n4. You get a Growl notification with all the info you'd ever need to judge someone's Twitter follow worth.
